# Instagram-Clone-with-Django
This project is a simplified version of Instagram built using Django and MySQL. It features essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing users to manage posts. Users can create posts with titles, images, and descriptions, view a list of posts, update post details, and delete posts if needed.
The project structure follows Django's best practices, including the use of templates for dynamic content rendering, app-specific folder organization, and database interactions via Django's ORM. The backend is powered by MySQL for robust data storage, while the frontend uses Django templates for rendering user-friendly interfaces.
This project is ideal for showcasing full-stack development skills, database integration, and Django's powerful features like URL routing, views, and template rendering.
